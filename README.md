This practice project is a simple React application for generating passwords with customizable options. Let me break down the key components and functionalities of this project:
The project uses React's useState hook to manage several pieces of state:
The passwordGenerator function generates a random password based on the user's preferences for length, numbers, and special characters. It uses the Math.random function and a character string that includes uppercase and lowercase letters. If numbers or special characters are allowed, they are added to the character string. The function sets the generated password and resets the "Copied" and background color flags.
useCallback is used to memoize the passwordGenerator and copyPassword functions. This helps prevent unnecessary re-renders and maintains stable references to these functions.
useRef is used to create a reference to the password input field, allowing the application to select and copy the password to the clipboard.
The copyPassword function is responsible for copying the generated password to the clipboard. It sets the "Copied" flag and changes the background color of the password display box when the password is successfully copied.
An useEffect hook is used to call the passwordGenerator function whenever there are changes in the length, numberAllow, or charAllow state variables. This ensures that the password is generated and updated whenever the user modifies the settings.
In summary, this project is a simple React-based password generator application that allows users to create custom passwords with varying lengths, numbers, and special characters. The use of state management, hooks, and user interface elements makes it a practical example of building a simple web application using React.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
